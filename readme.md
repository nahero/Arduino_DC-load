# Arduino based DC load project for testing power supplies

Based on Scullcom DC load:
http://www.scullcom.uk/design-build-an-electronic-dc-load-part-1/

Should provide Constant Current, Constant Voltage and Constant Resistance modes.

My V1.0 currently provides Constant Current, monitoring, and switchable external function generator input 
mostly for testing transient response via square wave injection. Still on breadboard.
